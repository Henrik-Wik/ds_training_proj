# Training and Health Analysis (WIP)

## Overview

* Using data I have gathered over the years I explore the relationships between my training and bodyweight. I will also use machine learning in order to predict future progress and determine plateaus.
* Main factors are exercises, reps, weight, bodyweight, and time.
* Using this analysis I can get an insight into how my strength have changed over time, and how my bodyweight have changed in parallel. Furthermore, I can see if my progress will change in the future, which means I might have to change something in my programming.
* Excel, python and Power BI will be used for this.

## Objectives

* Show relationship between exercises and reps/weight.
* Show relationship between reps/weight and bodyweight.
* Show reps/weight, and bodyweight over time.
* Filter by exercise.
* Model future progress.
